The following web page Channelcapacity.htm (or alternatively Channelcapacity.pdf) 
presents two famous formulae for calculating communication capacity of the channel. 
They are known as Niquist and Shannon formula respectively.

The program NiqSha prompts the user for a communication bandwidth and number of signalling levels
for Niquist formula. For Shannon formula program promts the user for communication bandwidth
and the signal to noise ratio. 
It then calls functions to calculate the corresponding channel capacities, and prints the results.


WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
-------------------
  1. Try running NiqSha with various valid input (3 values of bandwidth ).
  2. Copy partially-finished program NiqSha.c into your own space and complete it in
     accordance with the information below. It should behave like NiqSha.
  3. Submit your NiqSha.c


ERROR CHECKING:
  None is needed.  You may assume the user enters proper input.

Other Instructions:
  Your program needs the logarithm for base 2 which is defined in math.h
  You have to find its name. This is how:
  Type the following command to find where math.h is located.
       whereis math.h
  Once you know where it is, edit it, and search for logarithm functions.
  Select the proper function to and use it in your program.

COMPILING:
  gcc may require the -lm flag (link math library), depending on the moon you're 
  using. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you finish early...
1. Try running NiqSha with bad input and see what happens.
2. Copy NiqSha.c to NiqShaM.c .
3. Modify NiqShaM.c and delete the function prototypes (pretend you forgot to code
   them.) Then try compiling and see what kind of error message you get.
4. Modify NiqShaM.c to sometimes use the wrong types (use int instead of double in 
   various places.) See what kind of error message (if any) and output (if any) 
   you get.
